# Table

Logical table as sequence of chunked arrays


## Overview

The JavaScript `Table` class is not part of the Apache Arrow specification as such, but is rather a tool to allow you to work with multiple record batches and array pieces as a single logical dataset.

As a relevant example, we may receive multiple small record batches in a socket stream, then need to concatenate them into contiguous memory for use in NumPy or pandas. The Table object makes this efficient without requiring additional memory copying.

A Tableâ€™s columns are instances of `Column`, which is a container for one or more arrays of the same type.


## Usage

`Table.new()` accepts an `Object` of `Columns` or `Vectors`, where the keys will be used as the field names for the `Schema`:

```js
const i32s = Int32Vector.from([1, 2, 3]);
const f32s = Float32Vector.from([.1, .2, .3]);
const table = Table.new({ i32: i32s, f32: f32s });
assert(table.schema.fields[0].name === 'i32');
```

It also accepts a a list of Vectors with an optional list of names or
Fields for the resulting Schema. If the list is omitted or a name is
missing, the numeric index of each Vector will be used as the name:

```ts
const i32s = Int32Vector.from([1, 2, 3]);
const f32s = Float32Vector.from([.1, .2, .3]);
const table = Table.new([i32s, f32s], ['i32']);
assert(table.schema.fields[0].name === 'i32');
assert(table.schema.fields[1].name === '1');
```

If the supplied arguments are `Column` instances, `Table.new` will infer the `Schema` from the `Column`s:

```ts
const i32s = Column.new('i32', Int32Vector.from([1, 2, 3]));
const f32s = Column.new('f32', Float32Vector.from([.1, .2, .3]));
const table = Table.new(i32s, f32s);
assert(table.schema.fields[0].name === 'i32');
assert(table.schema.fields[1].name === 'f32');
```

If the supplied Vector or Column lengths are unequal, `Table.new` will
extend the lengths of the shorter Columns, allocating additional bytes
to represent the additional null slots. The memory required to allocate
these additional bitmaps can be computed as:

```ts
let additionalBytes = 0;
for (let vec in shorter_vectors) {
 additionalBytes += (((longestLength - vec.length) + 63) & ~63) >> 3;
}
```

For example, an additional null bitmap for one million null values would require `125,000` bytes (`((1e6 + 63) & ~63) >> 3`), or approx. `0.11MiB`


## Inheritance

`Table` extends Chunked


## Static Methods

### Table.empty() : Table

Creates an empty table

### Table.from() : Table

Creates an empty table

### Table.from(source: RecordBatchReader): Table
### Table.from(source: Promise<RecordBatchReader>): Promise<Table>
### Table.from(source?: any) : Table
### Table.fromAsync(source: import('./ipc/reader').FromArgs): Promise<Table>
### Table.fromVectors(vectors: any[], names?: String[]) : Table
### Table.fromStruct(struct: Vector) : Table


### Table.new(columns: Object)
### Table.new(...columns)
### Table.new(vectors: Vector[], names: String[])

Type safe constructors. Functionally equivalent to calling `new Table()` with the same arguments, however if using Typescript using the `new` method instead will ensure that types inferred from the arguments "flow through" into the return Table type.


## Members

### schema (readonly)

The `Schema` of this table.


### length : Number (readonly)

The number of rows in this table.

TBD: this does not consider filters


### chunks : RecordBatch[] \(readonly)

The list of chunks in this table.


### numCols : Number (readonly)

The number of columns in this table.


## Methods

### constructor(batches: RecordBatch[])

The schema will be inferred from the record batches.

### constructor(...batches: RecordBatch[])

The schema will be inferred from the record batches.

### constructor(schema: Schema, batches: RecordBatch[])

### constructor(schema: Schema, ...batches: RecordBatch[])

### constructor(...args: any[])


Create a new `Table` from a collection of `Columns` or `Vectors`, with an optional list of names or `Fields`.

TBA

### assign(table: Table): Table

Returns a new table with the columns of the `table` parameter added to the the columns of the `Table` instance being assigned to. If any columns have the same name in both tables, the column from the `table` paramter will replace the columns from the original table.


Notes: 
- As usual, the original tables are not modified. 
- `Table.assign()` is a zero-copy operation only if both tables have the same batch structure and length.

Remarks:

- For fields (columns) that have the same names in both tables, the corresponding columns will be replaced (i.e. the columns in the original table will be replaced with the columns with the same name in the new table.)
- The order of columns will be the order of the columns in the original table, any columns with new names will be added at the end of the new table's `schema.fields`.
- Assigning new columns to Tables can be complicated in Arrow as tables can have a different batch structure and this needs to be aligned for assignment to work. The `table.assign()` method handle all this.
- The source and target tables can have different internal chunked/not chunked layouts, and can even be different lengths (the function append a new `RecordBatch` with empty null bitmaps to extend the length of shorter columns).
- The major caveat is it's difficult to go from chunked -> not chunked (without round-tripping through the Builders). There is not yet a "combine chunks" routine that could provide a more optimized typed-array implementation that merged contiguous chunks with copies (especially as merging bitmaps is complex).
- An example can be found in this [observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/d/de44f072e320e3f7).

### clone(chunks?:)

Returns a new copy of this table.

### getColumnAt(index: number): Column | null

Gets a column by index.

### getColumn(name: String): Column | null

Gets a column by name

### getColumnIndex(name: String) : Number | null

Returns the index of the column with name `name`.

### getChildAt(index: number): Column | null

TBD

### serialize(encoding = 'binary', stream = true) : Uint8Array

Returns a `Uint8Array` that contains an encoding of all the data in the table.

Note: Passing the returned data back into `Table.from()` creates a "deep clone" of the table.

### count(): number

TBD - Returns the number of elements.

### select(...columnNames: string[]) : Table

Returns a new Table with the specified subset of columns, in the specified order.

### countBy(name : Col | String) : Table

Returns a new Table that contains two columns (`values` and `counts`).
